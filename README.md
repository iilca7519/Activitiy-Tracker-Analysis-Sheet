How to use it?
In order to minimize number of touch points, I recommend adding a shortcut to this sheet on your home screen for your phone. Keep a home screen that is very minimalist and include max 2 shortcuts on your screen (the rest of the space could be occupied by widgets.) 
Further instructions can be found on the sheet. 

Why use it? 
This sheet is a beautiful creation of self development through the perspective of an analyst. This sheet includes some formulas in order to acheive certain visualizations. By using this sheet, you'll find yourself slowly but surely inching closer to your goals that you set. Each and every time you open this sheet, you are subconsciously enabling yourself to develop better habits and become a better version of yourself. The color-coded visualiations will bring the ultimate awareness to your activities. As time passes, you must also reflect and review how your progess has changed.

What other activities work well in conjunction with this sheet?
- Journaling
    - I recommend writing in a physical journal every day. 
- Mood tracker
    - I use an app called Pixels to track my mood every day.
